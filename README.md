## SupplyChainHub

This is a system which automates building of smart contract for any type of product, at minimal cost.

This project has two interfaces: Web App and Android App

The web platform is built in such a way that any user can build his own customized supply chain by deploying the auto generated supply chain.
A python script is used to generate this supply chain according to user needs.

It also features a p2p chat application, to connect all the members of the same supply chain. The chat app is built using ceramic, sockets and webrtc. Sockets and webrtc make the chat application realtime and ceramic is used to persist all messages.

The Android app uses web3j library to interact with the smart contract through Java.
Individual product can be tracked by scanning barcodes through a user friendly interface and the location can also be determined through Google Maps.

This is built on Matic Network for faster, scalable transactions.

This brings 100% transparency on trading of goods by broadcasting the quantity with every entity in the supply chain and the transactions they have made for trading. Even the end user, i.e the customer, can get all information for that product with just scanning the product.
